# dotfiles
Here are my ever-changing config files. Included is a Python3 installation script which first does a backup of your already existing files that will be overridden before doing a symlink to these configs.

## Installation
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/CSharpRon/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
python3 install.py
```
